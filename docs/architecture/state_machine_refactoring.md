# State Machine Expander Refactoring

## Overview

The `state_machine_expander.py` file has been refactored for improved maintainability and organization. The original implementation was over 1300 lines long, combining several distinct responsibilities in a single file. The new implementation breaks down the functionality into smaller, more focused modules while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Break down the large file into smaller, more manageable components
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Group related functionality into dedicated modules
3. **Better Testability**: Make individual components easier to test in isolation
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing code that imports from the original module continues to work
5. **Improved Type Safety**: Enhance type annotations for better static analysis

## Module Structure

The refactored code is organized into the following modules:

### 1. `/src/parser/state_machine/`

Main directory containing all the refactored components:

### 2. `/src/parser/state_machine/__init__.py`

Exports the main classes and functions for internal use within the module.

### 3. `/src/parser/state_machine/types.py`

Contains the fundamental type definitions:
- `TokenType` enum: Defines the different types of tokens (LITERAL, VARIABLE, etc.)
- `Token` class: Represents a token with its type, value, and raw text
- `State` enum: Defines the different states for the state machine

### 4. `/src/parser/state_machine/context.py`

Contains the `StateContext` class which manages the state machine context:
- Tracks position in the input text
- Maintains the state stack for nested constructs
- Collects tokens during processing
- Provides helper methods for state transitions

### 5. `/src/parser/state_machine/tokenizer.py`

Contains the `Tokenizer` class that implements the state machine for tokenization:
- Processes text character-by-character
- Transitions between states based on input
- Generates tokens of different types
- Handles nested structures

### 6. `/src/parser/state_machine/pattern_utils.py`

Contains utility functions for shell pattern handling:
- `shell_pattern_to_regex`: Converts shell wildcards to regex patterns
- `split_brace_pattern`: Splits brace patterns respecting nesting

### 7. `/src/parser/state_machine/variable_modifiers.py`

Contains functions for handling shell variable modifiers:
- `handle_pattern_removal`: Handles ${VAR#pattern} and ${VAR%pattern}
- `handle_pattern_substitution`: Handles ${VAR/pattern/replacement}
- `handle_case_modification`: Handles ${VAR^}, ${VAR^^}, etc.

### 8. `/src/parser/state_machine/expander.py`

Contains the main `StateMachineExpander` class which:
- Uses the Tokenizer to break input into tokens
- Expands each token according to its type
- Implements variable expansion, arithmetic evaluation, etc.
- Handles complex nested expressions

### 9. `/src/parser/state_machine_expander.py`

Compatibility layer that re-exports all components from the new modules to maintain backward compatibility with existing code.

## Improvements

1. **Simplified Code Navigation**: Related functionality is grouped together
2. **Reduced File Size**: Each file is now a manageable size
3. **Clear Dependencies**: Dependencies between components are explicit
4. **Better Type Annotations**: More specific type annotations for improved static analysis
5. **Isolated Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
6. **Maintainable Structure**: Easier to locate and modify specific functionality

## Backward Compatibility

The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility:
- All tests from the original `test_state_machine_expander.py` continue to pass
- External code that imports from `state_machine_expander.py` will continue to work
- The public API remains unchanged

## Future Work

While the current refactoring focuses on structural improvements, some additional enhancements could be considered:

1. Optimize the pattern matching algorithm for better performance
2. Enhance error reporting with more specific error messages
3. Add more comprehensive documentation to complex methods
4. Implement additional shell parameter expansion features
5. Further improve type annotations for even better static analysis
