# Case Statement Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the case statement handling in psh (Python Shell). The fixes include:

1. Enhanced pattern matching in case statements to support multiple patterns separated by `|`
2. Improved debugging for case statement execution
3. Added comprehensive test coverage for case statements

## Implemented Changes

### Pattern Matching Enhancement

The `pattern_match` method in `ASTExecutor` has been improved to properly handle multiple patterns in case statements. The updated method now:

- Handles the special case of `*)` pattern (wildcard match)
- Processes pattern alternatives separated by `|` (e.g., `apple|orange|pear)`)
- Uses `fnmatch` for wildcard patterns (e.g., `*.txt`)

```python
def pattern_match(self, word: str, pattern: str) -> bool:
    """Match a word against a shell pattern
    
    Handles multiple patterns separated by | as in 'val1|val2|val3)' case items.
    """
    # Handle special case of *) pattern
    if pattern == '*':
        return True
    
    # Handle multiple patterns separated by |
    if '|' in pattern:
        patterns = [p.strip() for p in pattern.split('|')]
        return any(self.pattern_match(word, p) for p in patterns)
    
    # Use fnmatch for wildcard patterns
    return fnmatch.fnmatch(word, pattern)
```

### Improved Debug Logging

The `visit_case` method has been enhanced with debug logging to help diagnose issues with case statement evaluation:

```python
def visit_case(self, node: CaseNode) -> int:
    """Execute a case statement"""
    # Expand the word
    word = self.word_expander.expand(node.word)
    
    if self.debug_mode:
        print(f"[DEBUG] Case statement with word: '{word}'", file=sys.stderr)
    
    # Check each pattern...
    # (Debug logs added for pattern matching process)
```

### Comprehensive Test Coverage

New test cases have been added to verify case statement functionality:

1. `TestCaseStatements` class with comprehensive test methods covering:
   - Basic pattern matching
   - Single pattern case statements
   - Multiple pattern alternatives with `|`
   - Glob pattern handling (*.txt, etc.)

The tests ensure that:
- Patterns are correctly matched against words
- The correct actions are executed for matched patterns
- Default patterns (*) work correctly when no other patterns match

## Compatibility

The enhanced case statement handling correctly passes all compatibility tests with bash. This ensures that psh executes case statements in a way that is consistent with standard shell behavior.

## Future Improvements

Future enhancements could include:

1. Support for case statement fallthrough (;& and ;;& syntax)
2. Better error handling for malformed case statements
3. Performance optimizations for pattern matching with complex alternatives
