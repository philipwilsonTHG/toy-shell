# State Machine Migration Complete

As part of the migration to the new state machine-based parser, the following enhancements have been made:

1. The parser now properly handles multi-line statements by maintaining state between lines
2. Script execution has been improved to handle multi-line control structures
3. Nested control structures are partially supported
4. The parser can now determine when a statement is incomplete and wait for more input

## Multi-line Script Execution

The script execution has been enhanced to use the parser's built-in ability to track incomplete statements. This allows for proper parsing of multi-line control structures in scripts.

Key improvements:

- Uses a dedicated parser instance to maintain state between lines
- Processes lines one by one, accumulating them until complete statements are formed
- Uses the parser's built-in `is_incomplete()` method to determine when a statement is complete
- Preserves line structure for better parsing of nested structures
- Properly handles error recovery and reporting

## Remaining Issues

While basic multi-line statements now work, there are still some limitations:

1. Deeply nested control structures may not be parsed correctly
2. The parser sometimes treats nested control structure keywords as command arguments
3. More work is needed to fully support all forms of nesting

## Next Steps

To fully support nested control structures, a more extensive parser rewrite would be needed to:

1. Properly track control structure keywords in nested contexts
2. Implement a true recursive descent parser for nested structures
3. Enhance the token stream handling to better distinguish keywords from arguments
4. Improve the AST representation of nested structures

For now, the current implementation allows basic multi-line scripts to work correctly, which addresses the immediate need.
