# Design Strategy for POSIX Shell Control Structures

## Current Architecture Limitations
- Processes input line-by-line
- Lacks syntax understanding beyond tokenization
- No concept of blocks or multi-line statements
- No AST for representing program structure

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Enhance Lexer/Parser
- Add keywords (`if`, `then`, `else`, `for`, etc.)
- Build an Abstract Syntax Tree instead of just tokenizing
- Support multi-line input collection until complete blocks
- Track line numbers for error reporting

### 2. Create Abstract Syntax Structures
- Define node types (IfNode, WhileNode, ForNode, CaseNode, etc.)
- Support nested statements and code blocks
- Implement proper scoping for variables

### 3. Implement AST Executor
- Add visitor pattern for each node type
- Handle conditional execution based on exit codes
- Manage variable scope appropriately
- Support command substitution within control structures

### 4. Add Condition Testing
- Implement `test` builtin with file/string/numeric tests
- Support bracket syntax (`[ condition ]`)
- Handle boolean operations (`-a`, `-o`)
- Add numeric comparison operators

### 5. Update Shell Interface
- Extend prompt system for continuation lines (PS2)
- Buffer input until complete statements
- Add statement validation logic
- Support interrupting incomplete blocks

## Implementation Phases
1. Basic if/then/else/fi support
2. while/until loops
3. for loops
4. case statements
5. functions
6. Compound conditionals with && and ||
