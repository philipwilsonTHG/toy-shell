# AST Shell Implementation Summary

We've successfully extended the toy shell to build and execute an abstract syntax tree (AST), enabling support for control structures like conditionals, loops, and functions. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

## 1. AST Node Definitions (`src/parser/ast.py`)
- Created a comprehensive hierarchy of AST nodes:
  - `CommandNode` for simple commands
  - `PipelineNode` for command pipelines
  - `IfNode` for conditionals
  - `WhileNode` for while/until loops
  - `ForNode` for for loops
  - `CaseNode` for case statements
  - `FunctionNode` for function definitions
  - `ListNode` for compound statements
- Implemented the visitor pattern with `ASTVisitor` base class

## 2. Lexer Enhancements (`src/parser/lexer.py`)
- Added recognition of shell keywords (if, then, else, while, etc.)
- Modified tokenization to identify and tag control structure keywords
- Enhanced the token representation to support different token types

## 3. Parser Implementation (`src/parser/parser.py`)
- Built a recursive descent parser capable of handling:
  - Conditionals (if/then/else/fi)
  - Loops (while/until/for)
  - Case statements
  - Function definitions
- Added support for multi-line input with proper continuation
- Handled special cases like pattern matching in case statements

## 4. AST Executor (`src/execution/ast_executor.py`)
- Implemented visitor methods for each node type
- Created a variable scope system with inheritance for nested scopes
- Added function registry for handling function definitions and calls
- Implemented variable expansion in commands and arguments
- Connected AST execution to the existing pipeline mechanism

## 5. Shell Integration (`src/shell.py`)
- Modified the shell to use the new parser and executor
- Added support for PS2 continuation prompts for multi-line input
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Gracefully handled interrupts during multi-line input

## 6. Testing
- Added comprehensive tests for the parser and AST nodes
- Created test cases for control structures
- Developed a test script to demonstrate functionality

## Features Implemented
- If/then/else/fi conditionals
- While and until loops
- For loops with variable iteration
- Case statements with pattern matching
- Function definitions and calls
- Proper variable scoping
- Nested control structures

## Challenges and Future Work
- Some edge cases with variable expansion need further refinement
- More robust error handling for malformed scripts
- Enhanced pattern matching for case statements
- Command substitution within control structures
- Support for more complex shell patterns like subshells

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a shell with proper control structures, significantly enhancing its capabilities beyond simple command execution. The parser and executor design is extensible, making it easy to add additional shell features in the future.
